# Brooke Long‑Fox — Research Website Starter

This is a zero‑build static site (HTML/CSS) designed for GitHub Pages. No frameworks or tooling required.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository named `<your-username>.github.io`.
2. Upload the contents of this folder (not the parent folder) to the repo root.
3. Commit and push. Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

## Customize
- Edit `index.html` and `research.html` to update your four pillars.
- Add links to ORCID, Google Scholar, MorphoBank, Zenodo, and GitHub in the footer.
- Replace placeholder text with your publications and datasets in `publications.html`.
- All styles are in `assets/style.css`.

## Accessibility & SEO
- All pages use semantic HTML, large hit targets, and focus styles.
- Add your social preview image as `assets/og.png` and insert standard Open Graph tags in `<head>`.
